This is a work is exacuted by  Vladimir Savchenko as a test task for Aprimind company.

The app is a message form.

The app consists from front-end and back-end.

Fron-end is executed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Front-end verifies data typed by user.
If data are not valid they are not being sent. If data are valid they are being sent by AJAX.

Back-end executes verification too and make data innocuous. If data are valid they are being 
inserted to the database and show user all data stored in the database.

Application is working if user turned off Javascrip. In this case application is fully workable
just no so usable.
